# CannyEdgeDetection
## Created 12/20/2022

This is the term project of my team during the course Introduction to computer vision, which we decided to use C# and EmguCV library to program the Canny Edge detection algorithm, one of the most important edge detection algorithm in image processing nowadays.

The Canny Edge Detection includes 5 stages
- Noise reduction using Gaussian filter
- Gradient calculation
- Non-maximum suppression
- Double thresholding
- Edge tracking by hysteresis
